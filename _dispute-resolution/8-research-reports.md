### <a name="sidra-international-dispute-resolution"></a> Research on International Dispute Resolution 

SIDRA's International Dispute Resolution program aims to conduct leading research on the most challenging issues related to the ‘appropriate dispute resolution’ of cross-border disputes, and provide an Asian-based platform for robust global discourse on dispute resolution ecosystems, encompassing litigation, arbitration, mediation and mixed mode dispute resolution procedures.

SIDRA's R&D team is committed to developing evidence-based knowledge relation on international dispute resolution and translating it into practical insights to better inform how we engage in and resolve disputes.

The first major project within this program is the SIDRA Survey on International Dispute Resolution commissioned by the Singapore Ministry of Law and administered in partnership with PwC South East Asia Consulting. The SIDRA Survey aims to learn more about how businesses and their legal advisers make decisions about resolving cross-border disputes, and why. 

All respondents are users and they are identified either as external legal counsel, in-house legal counsel or C-Suite executives of corporations that engage in cross-border trade. The views are based on user experiences and not just preferences. Once respondents indicated that they had used a particular dispute resolution process, they were then asked to respond to a series of specific questions in relation to that mechanism. If they did not have experience with a particular process, the survey directed them to the next process category. The survey questionaire was distributed internationally in multiple languages of English, Chinese, Arabic, Russian, French and Spanish, to reach a more diverse selection of users compared to those who primarily work in English.

### <a name="sidra-scm"></a> Research on Singapore Convention on Mediation

The Singapore Convention on Mediation is a multilateral treaty which offers a legal framework facilitating the circulation of international mediated settlement agreements (iMSAs) across national borders. The Singapore Convention achieves this by elevating iMSAs to the status of a new type of legal instrument recognised in international law: neither a contract nor a consent arbitral award, iMSAs that fall within the scope of, and that satisfy the conditions within, the Singapore Convention enjoy a unique status. The new Convention establishes a system for the recognition and enforcement of commercial iMSAs.

The Singapore Convention is a game changer which promises to leave a significant impact on international dispute resolution practices and, beyond that, on trade and investment flows. From a user perspective, the Singapore Convention offers a risk management mechanism accessible in terms of its flexibility and affordability to cross-border business players, whether they are multi-national corporations, publically listed corporations, traditional incorporated limited entities, sole traders, or start-ups.

SIDRA is at the vanguard of research and international capacity building in this fast moving field. Its key research projects on the SCM include: 
- **Singapore Convention on Mediation -- A Commentary** has been described as 'an essential book, very timely, immensely readable, a revelation'. Given the significant developments in the field, SIDRA's R&D team is already conducting research for the second edition, which will feature a deep analysis of legal issues related to ratification. It will examine issues such as the application of the Convention to international investment dispute and to trust arrangements, remedies under the Singapore Convention, the role mediator standards and ethics in setting aside iMSAs, and practical implications of the reservations. Readers will also find comprehensive updates on States that have signed and those that have ratified.

- **International and Comparative Mediation – An Asian Perspective** will feature comparative research on the mediation eco-systems in civil and common law systems in Asia with a focus on China, Japan, Korea, Indonesia, India, Philippines and Singapore.

### <a name="sidra-belt-and-road"></a> Research on Belt and Road Initiative

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is a policy centerpiece of China's foreign strategy. As at July 2019, it was reported that the People's Republic of China had concluded 195 inter-governmental cooperation agreements with 136 countries and 30 international organizations, ranging from Eurasia to African, Latin American, South Pacific and Western European countries. Specifically, the BRI has already given rise to a number of symbolic projects in South-East Asia, such as the construction of the China-Laos Railway, the China-Thailand Railway, and the China-Myanmar Oil & Gas Pipeline.

SIDRA's BRI research aims to navigate between the intersection of substantive laws and the different modes of BRI dispute resolution. By way of specific examples, potential research areas include issues of arbitrability, sovereign immunity, enforcement of court judgments, arbitral and mediated settlement awards, the use of dispute resolution mechanisms and instruments such as international commercial courts, the Singapore Mediation Convention and dispute resolution boards, the use of free-trade agreements and investor-state treaty protections, and conflict of laws issues. 

SIDRA's research will focus pre-dominantly on Asia and ASEAN within which SIDRA is geographically situated. SIDRA's BRI program aims to contribute to global BRI discourse perspectives on complexities that would particularly arise in BRI dispute resolution in Asia and ASEAN. The diversity of the countries in Asia and ASEAN, including variations in terms of economic development strategies, legal systems, language and culture, provides an ample starting point for discussion, reflection and debate on BRI's impact.

SIDRA will also actively explore collaboration opportunities with suitable organisations and visiting faculty to promulgate its activities and research across BRI jurisdictions, including China.
