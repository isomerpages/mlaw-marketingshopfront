The Singapore International Dispute Resolution Academy (SIDRA) is a platform for thought leadership in international dispute resolution theory, practice and policy. 

A research centre at the Singapore Management University Yong Pung How School of Law, SIDRA leads the way through projects, publications and events that promote dynamic and inclusive conversations on how to constructively engage with and resolve differences and disputes at global, regional and national levels. In particular, SIDRA differentiates itself through its focus on applied research that has practical impact on industry, including conducting SIMI Registered Training Programmes for mediator accreditation, and IMI-accredited training programmes for mediation advocacy.

SIDRA conducts regular research on topics related to:
- International Dispute Resolution Survey which offers an Asian-based platform for robust global discourse on dispute resolution ecosystems, encompassing litigation, arbitration, mediation, mixed mode dispute resolution procedures and investor-state disputes. The SIDRA International Dispute Resolution Survey aims to learn more about how and why businesses and lawyers make decisions about resolving cross-border commercial disputes., and deals with issues at the forefront of debate such as technology, diversity, and third-party funding. Data collection is carried out through an online survey as well as qualitative interviews with select users. SIDRA has recently launched the 2nd edition of the online Survey.
