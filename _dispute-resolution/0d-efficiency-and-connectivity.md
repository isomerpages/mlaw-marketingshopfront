## Fast and cost-efficient

Based on the World Bank Doing Business Report 2020, resolving a commercial dispute through the Singapore Courts takes just 164 days, the shortest time recorded worldwide – under half the time in New York, and about a third the time in London.

Arbitration costs in Singapore are, in general, lower than most major centres of arbitration. As part of building a robust and vibrant legal services hub, Singapore offers arbitration-specific tax exemptions for non-resident foreign arbitrators.

## Global connectivity

Singapore’s prime geographical location and stellar transportation and communication links

make us one of the most well-connected cities in the world. Over 100 airlines fly from Singapore’s award-winning Changi Airport to more than 400 cities around the globe. Travel times are short in our compact city, with excellent infrastructure critical to business travellers. **For virtual and hybrid hearing arrangements and measures in view of COVID-19 pandemic, please click here.** [Note: to link to the “Remote hearing and other measures in response to COVID-19 pandemic” section]
