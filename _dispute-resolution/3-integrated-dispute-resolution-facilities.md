Parties seeking to resolve their disputes by alternative dispute resolution in Singapore can enjoy access to state-of-the-art support facilities at the **Maxwell Chambers**.

Maxwell Chambers is the world’s first integrated Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) complex, housing both best-in-class hearing facilities as well as top international ADR institutions. 

It is centrally located in the heart of Singapore’s business district, and is a preferred hearing centre for parties, counsel, arbitrators and mediators. Maxwell Chambers caters to a wide range of international and local users, and houses 34 entities, including the World Intellectual Property Organisation Arbitration and Mediation Centre's first overseas office outside Geneva, the International Chamber of Commerce’s and American Arbitration Association’s first regional offices in Asia, and a case management office of the Permanent Court of Arbitration.

Maxwell Chambers provides purpose-built secure hearing facilities for arbitration and mediation, as well as offices for dispute resolution institutions and firms. Maxwell Chambers Suites also provides a 24-hour business centre with concierge and secretarial services, state-of-the-art IT facilities and high-speed connectivity.

Its extension, Maxwell Chambers Suites, was constructed to meet the growing demand for dispute resolution work. Dedicated to housing dispute resolution institutions and firms, the beautifully conserved building has tripled the complex’s capacity.

Maxwell Chambers Suites also has six specially designed executive suites for short-term rental to cater to arbitrators, mediators and counsel who are based overseas but fly in and out of Singapore for dispute resolution. This provides a secure office space staffed by a secretariat that is familiar with the needs of dispute resolution work.

Parties who wish to adopt a hybrid hearing can also make use of the breakout rooms which have safe management measures in place.

Parties and tribunals can connect through an integrated platform for case preparation and converged hearing room services. A secure cloud-based platform will enable you to access your materials from anywhere and collaborate online in a single connected environment. This allows parties to work around current travel restrictions.
