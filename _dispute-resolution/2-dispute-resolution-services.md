## Integrated Dispute Resolution Complex

Parties seeking to resolve their disputes by alternative dispute resolution in Singapore will also enjoy access to state-of-the-art support facilities at the **Maxwell Chambers** 

Maxwell Chambers houses purpose-built secured hearing facilities for arbitration and mediation, as well as offices for dispute resolution institutions and firms. Maxwell Chambers Suites also provides a 24-hour business centre with concierge and secretariat services, state-of-the-art IT facilities and high-speed connectivity.

Its extension, Maxwell Chambers Suites, was constructed to meet growing demand for dispute resolution work. Dedicated to housing dispute resolution institutions and firms, the beautifully conserved building has tripled the complex’s capacity.

Maxwell Chambers Suites also has six specially-designed executive suites for short-term rental to cater to arbitrators, mediators and counsel who are based overseas but fly in and out of Singapore for dispute resolution. This provides a secure office space staffed by a secretariat that is familiar with the needs of dispute resolution work.

Maxwell Chambers Suites houses a number of dispute firms and international dispute resolution institutions. Six of the 11 international institutions, including the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Court of Arbitration and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, have their case management offices in the building, giving Maxwell Chambers Suites the highest concentration of case management offices in a facility in the world.
