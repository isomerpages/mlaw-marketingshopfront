## Modern and responsive laws

Singapore’s arbitration legislation is regularly reviewed to keep abreast of international best practices and commercial developments.

**Interim orders in aid of foreign arbitration**

Singapore’s arbitration legislation adopts UNCITRAL Model Law provisions, including those empowering the Court to grant interim orders in aid of foreign arbitration.

**Emergency arbitration**

Singapore was one of the first jurisdictions to provide clear legislative support for the appointment of an emergency arbitrator, and for any resulting order. The emergency arbitrator procedure enables parties to obtain urgently required interim relief before a Tribunal is constituted, without the need to go to Court.

**State-investor disputes**

Singapore International Arbitration Centre is the first commercial arbitral institution to offer a stand-alone set of rules to address the special features and demands of arbitration proceedings involving States, State-controlled entities or intergovernmental organisations, whether arising out of a contract, statute, treaty or other instrument. The 1st edition of the SIAC Investment Arbitration Rules came into effect on 1 January 2017.

## Cost advantage and tax incentives

Arbitration costs in Singapore are, in general, lower than most major centres of arbitration. As part of building a robust and vibrant legal services hub, Singapore offers arbitration-specific tax exemptions for non-resident foreign arbitrators.

## Judicial support

There is strong judicial support  where the judicial philosophy is to accord a substantial degree of judicial deference to the outcomes and processes of international commercial arbitration in recognition of party autonomy. In Singapore, our courts have been slow to assume jurisdiction over a matter that the parties have agreed to refer to international arbitration, intervening only where appropriate and necessary to do so, and within the framework provided for by the New York Convention and our International Arbitration Act.

Where the arbitration matters are brought before the High Court, specially-appointed judges, who have the experience to handle a wide range of complex issues, preside over them.
