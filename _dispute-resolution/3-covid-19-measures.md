## Protocols And Services

While the offices of some of the dispute resolution institutions may be partially closed for some days of the week, the institutions remain fully operational.

Various institutions have also developed new measures in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

### SIMC COVID-19 Protocol

The Covid-19 pandemic has severely impacted global business communities, threatening commercial relationships and leading to disputes. With expedited mediation, businesses may devote their resources towards navigating other challenges, instead of diverting them to conduct potentially protracted and expensive legal proceedings. This will put them in a stronger position to recover amidst the growing economic uncertainty.

In view of the potential commercial disputes during the COVID-19 period, Singapore International Mediation Centre (SIMC) introduced the SIMC COVID-19 Protocol, which will be in force until end-2020, to provide parties with an expedited, economical and effective means for resolving disputes.

The Protocol is designed to complement legislation on Covid-19. In Singapore, parties who enjoy relief under the [COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/covid19-relief/) (“the Act”), can mediate at any time – even after an Assessor’s determination. Under the protocol, mediation is conducted online. Settlement agreements are enforceable. They may be recorded as court orders under the Mediation Act 2017 or enforced under the [Singapore Convention on Mediation](http://simc.com.sg/the-singapore-convention-on-mediation/) (from 12 September 2020 in countries that have ratified the Convention).
