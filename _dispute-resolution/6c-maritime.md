## Maritime Dispute Resolution

Singapore is listed as one of the three arbitral seats in the Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO) Standard Dispute Resolution Clause, the New York Produce Exchange (NYPE) Time Charter Party 2015, and the Singapore Ship Sale Form.

### Hybrid Model

The Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA) Rules are created by and for the maritime and international trading communities. They are based on a hybrid model of non-administered arbitration with optional features.

The optional features that parties may utilise are:

- Appointing authority
- Determining challenges to the tribunal
- Fund-holding services
- Authentication of awards under the Singapore International Arbitration Act.

### Specialist Maritime Rules

SCMA also maintains specialised arbitration rules to cater to technical marine disputes such as the Singapore Bunker Claims Procedure for bunker quality or quantity disputes, and the SCMA Expedited Arbitral Determination of Collision Claims for collision disputes.

### Freedom of Appointment

Users have complete autonomy to appoint arbitrators of their own choice or from SCMA’s Panel of Arbitrators. They may also request the assistance of the SCMA Chairman to break a deadlock in an arbitrator appointment or determine a challenge to an arbitrator.

### Cost

There are no fees payable to the SCMA to commence an SCMA arbitration. There is also no mandatory scale of arbitrators’ fees based on the amount in dispute (also known as ad-valorem fees). Parties are free to independently agree upon rates with the arbitrator(s).
