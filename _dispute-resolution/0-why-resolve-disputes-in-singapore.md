**Efficiency, economy and innovation**  are the hallmarks of dispute resolution in Singapore. In a business environment of increasing complexity and uncertainty, Singapore stands out as a trusted and safe venue for dispute resolution.

The World Bank Doing Business Report 2020 ranks Singapore first globally in the contract enforcement variable - which measures the efficiency of a judicial system in resolving commercial disputes. Singapore consistently ranks amongst the top of the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings as the world’s easiest place to do business.

Singapore’s judiciary is well-respected for efficiency, competence and honesty. Singapore courts also have a strong international outlook, and increasingly consider a wide diversity of foreign judgments in their decisions.

Based on the World Bank Doing Business Report 2020, resolving a commercial dispute through the Singapore Courts takes just 164 days, the shortest time recorded worldwide – under half the time in New York, and about a third the time in London.

>“I have sat as an arbitrator in a number of cases at Maxwell Chambers. I have found the facilities to be excellent. From the moment that one arrives at Maxwell Chambers, the staff make every effort to be helpful, and are unfailingly cheerful and welcoming. The facilities in the hearing rooms are very good. The rooms are light and airy and have good acoustics. All in all, I have found Maxwell Chambers to be the equal of any other arbitration facilities at which I have heard cases, and far better than most.”

Its extension, Maxwell Chambers Suites, was constructed to meet growing demand for dispute resolution work. Dedicated to housing dispute resolution institutions and firms, the beautifully conserved building has tripled the complex’s capacity.

This provides a secure office space staffed by a secretariat that is familiar with the needs of dispute resolution work.

Maxwell Chambers Suites houses a number of dispute firms and international dispute resolution institutions. Six of the 11 international institutions, including the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Court of Arbitration and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, have their case management offices in the building, giving Maxwell Chambers Suites the highest concentration of case management offices in a facility in the world.
