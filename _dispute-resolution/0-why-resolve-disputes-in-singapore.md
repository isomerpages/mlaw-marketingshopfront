**Efficiency, economy and innovation**  are the hallmarks of dispute resolution in Singapore. In a business environment of increasing complexity and uncertainty, Singapore stands out as a trusted and safe venue for dispute resolution.

The World Bank Doing Business Report 2020 ranks Singapore first globally in the contract enforcement variable - which measures the efficiency of a judicial system in resolving commercial disputes. Singapore consistently ranks amongst the top of the World Bank’s Doing Business rankings as the world’s easiest place to do business.

## Pro-business environment

With supportive government policies and a pro-business environment, international parties seeking to resolve commercial disputes in Singapore can expect laws that are responsive and keenly attuned to their needs. We keep abreast of commercial developments and international best practice in the knowledge that law, like the businesses it protects, does not stand still.

## Trusted legal system

With a strong reputation for good governance, low corruption, efficiency, rule of law and a trusted legal system, Singapore is an independent and neutral venue.

World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2020 ranks Singapore 12th worldwide and top in Asia. Transparency International’s 2019 Corruption Perception Index ranks Singapore as the 4th least corrupt country in the world and the second least corrupt country in Asia Pacific.

## Respected judiciary

Singapore’s judiciary is well-respected for efficiency, competence and honesty. Singapore courts also have a strong international outlook, and increasingly consider a wide diversity of foreign judgments in their decisions.

## Efficiency

Based on the World Bank Doing Business Report 2020, resolving a commercial dispute through the Singapore Courts takes just 164 days, the shortest time recorded worldwide – under half the time in New York, and about a third the time in London.

## Global connectivity

Singapore’s prime geographical location and stellar transportation and communication links

make us one of the most well-connected cities in the world. Over 100 airlines fly from Singapore’s award-winning Changi Airport to more than 400 cities around the globe. Travel times are short in our compact city, with excellent infrastructure critical to business travellers. **For virtual and hybrid hearing arrangements and measures in view of COVID-19 pandemic, please click here.** *Note: to link to the “Remote hearing and other measures in response to COVID-19 pandemic” section*

*(Note: This is a sample of a testimonial we could include. This is taken from Maxwell Chamber’s website. We will work with stakeholders to identify testimonials to add to various sections of the website)*

>“I have sat as an arbitrator in a number of cases at Maxwell Chambers. I have found the facilities to be excellent. From the moment that one arrives at Maxwell Chambers, the staff make every effort to be helpful, and are unfailingly cheerful and welcoming. The facilities in the hearing rooms are very good. The rooms are light and airy and have good acoustics. All in all, I have found Maxwell Chambers to be the equal of any other arbitration facilities at which I have heard cases, and far better than most.”

Its extension, Maxwell Chambers Suites, was constructed to meet growing demand for dispute resolution work. Dedicated to housing dispute resolution institutions and firms, the beautifully conserved building has tripled the complex’s capacity.

Maxwell Chambers Suites also has six specially-designed executive suites for short-term rental to cater to arbitrators, mediators and counsel who are based overseas but fly in and out of Singapore for dispute resolution. This provides a secure office space staffed by a secretariat that is familiar with the needs of dispute resolution work.

Maxwell Chambers Suites houses a number of dispute firms and international dispute resolution institutions. Six of the 11 international institutions, including the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Court of Arbitration and the Permanent Court of Arbitration, have their case management offices in the building, giving Maxwell Chambers Suites the highest concentration of case management offices in a facility in the world.
