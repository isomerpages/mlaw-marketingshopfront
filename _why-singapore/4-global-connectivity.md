Singapore’s prime geographical location and stellar transportation and communication links make us one of the most well-connected cities in the world. Over 100 airlines fly from Singapore’s award-winning Changi Airport to more than 400 cities around the globe. Travel times are short in our compact city, with excellent infrastructure critical to business travellers. 

COVID-19 has undeniably affected international travel and exchanges. Singapore is committed to strengthen connectivity amidst COVID-19 disruptions and has formulated contigency plans to minimise impact.
