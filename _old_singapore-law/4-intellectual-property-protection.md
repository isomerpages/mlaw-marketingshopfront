### A Robust IP Regime  
Singapore provides one of the world’s most robust regimes for the protection of a company’s intellectual property (IP).  

International surveys consistently rank Singapore’s Intellectual Property (IP) regime as one of the best in the world. For example, Singapore is ranked second in the world and top in Asia for having the best IP protection in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report. For more information on Singapore’s IP rankings, please click [here](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/who-we-are/singapore-ip-ranking).  

Singapore’s business-friendly IP regime has helped bolster the confidence of leading global companies such as P&G, Continental, and Mead Johnson, all of whom have selected Singapore as their location of choice for investments in business and R&D, citing the country’s strong protection of IP rights as a factor in their decisions.

### Categories of IP Protection
Singapore law recognises and provides protection for a range of IP rights. Some of these IP rights may be registered with the Intellectual Property Office of Singapore (IPOS), a government agency under the Ministry of Law. Yet other IP rights may be protected by Singapore law even though there is no system of registration.   

The table below provides more information on the main categories of IP rights in Singapore as well as links to some key resources.

### Key Strengths of Singapore’s IP Regime

* **International Treaties**
  * Singapore is a signatory to major multilateral IP agreements such as the Patent Cooperation Treaty, the Madrid Protocol, the Hague Agreement, and the Berne Convention. This allows, for example, a Singapore resident to seek patent, trade mark, or registered design protection in several countries simultaneously via a single application.

* **International Searching and Preliminary Examining Authority (ISA/IPEA) for patents**
  * IPOS is the first IP office in Southeast Asia to be recognised as an ISA/IPEA under the WIPO Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT). Patent applicants in more than 10 jurisdictions, including the US, Japan, and Korea, can elect IPOS to perform the International Search and Preliminary Examination in order to obtain patent protection in any of the PCT’s over 150 contracting states.

* **Acceleration Programmes**
  * **Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) and ASEAN Patent Examination Co-operation (ASPEC).** Through IPOS’ network of work-sharing programmes, patent applications can rely on a Singapore patent report to expedite the patent application process in more than 30 jurisdictions, including the US, Japan, Korea, China, Europe and eight other Southeast Asia countries. Furthermore, under the ASPEC Acceleration for Industry 4.0 Infrastructure and Manufacturing (ASPEC AIM) programme, Industry 4.0 patent applications (e.g. in the field of AI) are prioritised.
  * Under the **SG IP Fast Track**, patent applications in all technology fields which are first filed in Singapore can be granted in as fast as six months. Related trade mark and registered design applications can also be accelerated, to be registered in as fast as three months and one month respectively.
  * More information on acceleration programmes can be found [here](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/protecting-your-ideas/patent/application-process/accelerated-programmes).

* **Forward-looking and Customer-centric Registry**

  * The **IPOS GO mobile app** allows users to conveniently file trade mark applications, and renew patents, trade marks and registered designs, on the go.
  * More information can be found [here](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/e-services).

* **Strong Ecosystem**
  * Singapore is home to a strong ecosystem of law firms, patent firms, specialist IP firms, intermediaries and consulting firms.
