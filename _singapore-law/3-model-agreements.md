## Model Agreements for Venture Capital Investments

Venture capital investments are becoming increasingly prevalent in Singapore and Southeast Asia, and this trend is expected to continue. Each investment may be unique, but there is no need for founders and investors (and their respective advisors) to spend time and incur costs by preparing and negotiating each investment from scratch, especially for early stage financing.

Developed by the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) and Singapore Venture Capital and Private Equity Association, the  Venture Capital Investment Model Agreements (VIMA)  provide a set of model agreements for use in seed rounds and early stage financing. It helps to cut down on transaction costs and reduce friction during the negotiating process.
