Singapore provides one of the world’s most robust regimes for the protection of a company’s intellectual property (IP). 

In Singapore, there are three mechanisms by which IP rights can be registered:

 - **Patent** (IP of inventive process or design)
 - **Copyright** (Product of an artist or writer)
 - **Trademark** (Grants businesses the exclusive rights to the name or symbol they use to mark their company and goods)
   
Singapore’s business-friendly IP regime has helped bolster the confidence of leading global companies such as P&G, Continental, and Mead Johnson, all of whom have selected Singapore as their location of choice for investments in business and R&D, citing the country’s strong protection of IP rights as a factor in their decisions.

Some key strengths of Singapore's IP regime are:
- Singapore is home to a strong ecosystem of legal and IP firms, including law firms, patent firms, intermediaries and consulting firms. Its liberalised patent agent regime allows foreign-qualified patent agents to undertake offshore patent agency work from Singapore. 

- Singapore is a member country of the Madrid Protocol. Trademark owners may designate Singapore, through the Madrid Protocol, to seek protection of his trademark in up to 123 member countries*, including Singapore, simultaneously by filing one application with the home office. 

- Singapore is a Contracting State of The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works. Work originating in Singapore (i.e. work the author of which is a Singapore citizen / resident, or work first published in Singapore) will be given the same protection in each of the 179 Contracting States

- Singapore is a member of the Hague Union. Design owners can file a design protection via the Hague system. This means that design owners can protect their designs in up to 91 countries* simultaneously by filing one application with IPOS in one language, and by paying one set of fees.


International surveys consistently rank Singapore’s IP regime as one of the best in the world.

- Singapore is ranked second in the world and top in Asia for having the best IP protection in the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report 2019. Overall, Singapore is ranked first as the world's most competitive country.

- Singapore is ranked fourth on the International Property Rights Index 2019, which measures the strength of a country's property rights regime, including both intellectual and physical property rights.

- The U.S. Chamber International IP Index 2019 ranked Singapore tenth in the world based on 45 indicators that look at patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secrets protection.

- The 2020 Bloomberg Innovation Index, which scores economies using factors including research and development spending, manufacturing capability and concentration of high-tech public companies, ranked Singapore third in the world.

- The Global Innovation Index 2020, which ranks countries' innovation performance, ranked Singapore as the eighth most innovative nation in the world and top in Asia. Singapore maintains its lead as first in the world on the Innovation Input Sub-Index of the Global Innovation Index 2019, which gauges elements in the national economy that enable innovation activities.
