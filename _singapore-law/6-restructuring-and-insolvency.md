[This is a tentative content, pending further input from PAD]

Singapore’s Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act (IRDA) commenced in 30 July 2020. This is an omnibus legislaton that consolidates Singapore’s personal insolvency, corporate insolvency and debt restructuring laws into a single legislation.

Historically, Singapore’s insolvency law and practice has derived from English law and practice, and has had much in common with the regimes in similar common law countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong.

In December 2010, the Singapore Ministry of Law convened the Insolvency Law Review Committee (ILRC) to review Singapore’s bankruptcy and corporate insolvency regimes. In its report of 4 October 2013, the ILRC recommended (amongst other things) enhancements to the corporate rescue mechanisms and the adoption of the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency, which would be enacted by way of a consolidated insolvency act. More information about the recommendations of the ILRC can be found [here](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/files/news/public-consultations/2013/10/RevisedReportoftheInsolvencyLawReviewCommittee.pdf)

This report of the ILRC was followed by the constitution by the Ministry of Law of a Committee to Strengthen Singapore as an International Centre for Debt Restructuring (the CSSICDR), which was tasked with recommending initiatives to enhance Singapore’s effectiveness as a centre for international debt restructuring. The CSSICDR issued its Final Report on 20 April 2016, setting out 17 recommendations including introducing a rescue financing regime, and strengthening the quality of Singapore based insolvency professionals. More information about the recommendations of the CSSICDR can be found [here](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/files/news/public-consultations/2016/04/Recommendations%20of%20the%20Committee.pdf)

Due to the large number of recommendations of the two Committees, a phased approach was taken to implement the recommendations of the two Committees.

- First phase: In July 2015, amendments were made to the Bankruptcy Act to create a more rehabilitative discharge framework for bankrupts, and to encourage
institutional creditors to exercise financial prudence when granting credit.

- Second phase: In March 2017, amendments to the Companies Act enhanced Singapore’s corporate rescue and restructuring processes as well as positioned Singapore as a regional forum of choice for debt restructuring.

- Final phase: The Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act implemented the remaining recommendations of the ILRC and Restructuring Committee, which were not enacted in the BA Reforms and CA Reforms, and further reforms to the debt restructuring regime, pursuant to industry feedback. 


#### Key Features of the Act

On personal bankruptcy, the provisions largely retain the repealed Bankruptcy Act, following significant amendments to the latter in 2015. One noteworthy change is the increase of the maximum debt threshold for the Debt Repayment Scheme from $100,000 to $150,000.

On corporate debt restructuring and insolvency, the Act introduces new features, including:

- Restriction on certain contractual rights that are triggered upon the commencement of restructuring proceedings (i.e. ipso facto clauses). This facilitates restructuring of a distressed company’s business, where its contracts contain such clauses.

- Enlarging the range of causes of action which may be funded by third parties, specifically certain officeholder avoidance actions, which may otherwise not be pursued due to lack of funds.

- Summary procedure to dissolve companies that have insufficient assets to pay for the administration of the winding up.

- The Act also establishes a new licensing and regulatory regime for insolvency practitioners. This regime requires insolvency practitioners to uphold professional standards when performing insolvency and debt restructuring work in Singapore.

Since the passing of the Act, extensive work has been undertaken to draft the 48 related pieces of subsidiary legislation for the Act, and effect the necessary system
updates to bring the Act into force. A significant number of subsidiary legislation were entirely new pieces, including two new standalone Rules of Court setting out court procedure for corporate and personal restructuring and insolvency proceedings.

In addition, a root and branch review had been undertaken in respect of all the related subsidiary legislation to update and modernise the relevant provisions.

Public and closed group consultations were also carried out for the novel pieces of subsidiary legislation as part of the drafting process. 


#### Insolvency and restructuring measures in response to COVID-19

The unprecedented spread and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, together with closures and restrictions imposed by the safe distancing measures, has resulted in significant impact on businesses.

The COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act has increased monetary thresholds for insolvency from 20 April 2020 to ?????? [Note: to update]

The Ministry of Law is considering further temporary measures, in addition to the processes in the Act, to assist micro and small companies which, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, may require support to either restructure their debts or wind down their businesses. [Note: to update]
