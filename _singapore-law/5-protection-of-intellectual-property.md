Singapore provides one of the world’s most robust regimes for the protection of a company’s intellectual property (IP).

In Singapore, there are three mechanisms by which IP rights can be registered:

 - Patent (IP of inventive process or design)
 - Copyright (Product of an artist or writer)
 - Trademark (Grants businesses the exclusive rights to the name or
   symbol they use to mark their company and goods)
