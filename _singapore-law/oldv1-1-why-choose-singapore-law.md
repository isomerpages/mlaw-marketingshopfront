title: Why choose Singapore Law

---
Strongly associated with the strengths of the Singapore legal system, Singapore law is frequently adopted by contracting parties as a neutral choice of law. It may be chosen to govern transactions even if there is no connection between the parties or the transaction, and Singapore.

> According to an independent [2019 survey on Governing Law and Jurisdictional Choices in Cross-Border Transactions](https://www.sal.org.sg/Newsroom/News-Releases/NewsDetails/id/1102), Singapore law is the second-most adopted governing law in cross-border transactions in Asia after English law. Familiarity with the chosen governing law and the presence of an established legal system and jurisprudence are the top factors driving the choice of Singapore law even where there is no connection between Singapore and the parties or the transaction.

## Transparent, neutral and predictable

Singapore law is fair and transparent, with reliable and predictable results. As a common law jurisdiction, Singapore’s laws retain the commercial strengths and stability of that legal tradition.

## Modern and relevant

Responsive to changing global commercial practices, Singapore’s jurisprudence and legislation maintain a strong internationalist outlook, continuing to absorb and modify the common law as well as best practices from other mature legal systems.

Singapore law is uniquely placed to reflect the commercial context in Asia and is frequently chosen as the applicable law for contracts.

## International standards

Singapore adheres to international commercial standards and has ratified many multilateral commercial law treaties, such as the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the New York Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, the Singapore Convention on Mediation, and the Protocol Relating to the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks.

## Business-friendly framework

Singapore laws include an established and well-developed body of commercial laws, equipped to deal with cross-border transactions. In particular:

- Singapore contract law _[Note: will link to Singapore Statutes Online website]_ respects party autonomy and freedom of contract.

- Singapore’s rules of contractual interpretation do not interfere with, but seek to give effect to the contracting parties’ commercial intentions.

- Singapore courts generally recognise and enforce clauses relating to contractual indemnities and limits on damages.

- Under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act, parties to a contract are allowed, in specified circumstances, to confer enforceable rights on a third party.

Major forms of commercial security and quasi-security interests (such as guarantees and indemnities) are protected, through a system that allows quick and easy enforcement of such interests.

Effective provisional remedies are also available, such as injunctions and stays.

## Respected judiciary and laws

Singapore’s Supreme Court Judges are respected jurists with substantial expertise in adjudicating complex cross-border commercial disputes. Singapore has an established and developed body of jurisprudence with a strong foundation, and a legislative framework for commercial law that is modern and effective.

Singapore Courts interpreting Singapore law contracts will primarily look to the ordinary meaning of the language in contract (i.e. what a reasonable person would have understood the term to mean) instead of giving undue weight to the subjective common intent of the parties. This approach gives commercial parties greater certainty as to how the Singapore Courts will interpret their contracts.

## Fast and Cost-Efficient

The [World Bank Doing Business Report in 2020](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/ranking) ranked Singapore 1st globally for the efficiency of its judicial system in resolving commercial disputes. Resolving a commercial dispute through the Singapore Courts takes on average 164 days – less than half the time for New York and about a third of the time for London. Singapore law provides clear ethical guidelines on legal fees in addition to judicial control over legal fees, generally leading to costs savings as compared to major centres such as London or New York.
