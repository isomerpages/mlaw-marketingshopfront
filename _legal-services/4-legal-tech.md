### A Global Hub for LegalTech

Singapore boasts one of the largest legaltech ecosystem in Southeast Asia. 

Singapore’s legaltech ecosystem is at a mature stage of development, attributed by the technology agenda spearheaded by the Smart Nations initiative, the high concentration of multinational companies, and its mature financial market. Because of these, Singapore has become a fertile bed for innovation where fast-growing start-ups and global talent congregate.  

The [Future Law Innovation Programme (FLIP)](https://www.flip.org.sg/) by the Singapore Academy of Law (SAL) aims to drive innovation and encourage adoption of new technology across the legal sector. It facilitated the use of dedicated co-working space to incubate legal technology start-ups.

### Technology and Innovation Roadmap

The Technology & Innovation Roadmap (TIR) is a sector-wide plan by the Ministry of Law (MinLaw) to promote innovation, technology adoption and development in Singapore’s legal industry up to 2030. It identifies technologies that will impact and change legal services, and explores ways to support development and adoption of such technologies. The roadmap is the result of a series of four inter-connected workshops conducted between April to October 2019, facilitated by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and brought together participants from across the legal industry and adjacent industries and disciplines.

### Tech-celerate for Law

Tech-celerate for Law was a joint effort between the [Law Society of Singapore](https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/), the Ministry of Law, [Enterprise Singapore](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/) and the [Infocomm Media Development Authority](https://www.imda.gov.sg/) to support Singapore law practices in their digitalisation journey. Through the Tech-celerate scheme, Singapore law practices were empowered to adopt both the baseline and advanced technology solutions required to upgrade their service offerings and deliver enhanced legal services. 

These solutions were pre-scoped by industry and technical experts to ensure relevance and usefulness. With the broad-based deployment of these carefully selected solutions, prospective clients of Singapore law practices can expect services to be delivered with greater efficiency and value than before.
