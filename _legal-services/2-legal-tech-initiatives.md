The COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated the need for the adoption of technology across all sectors of the economy, including the legal eco-system. Social distancing measures have prompted the need for innovative solutions and workarounds for legal processes that traditionally required physical interactions. Law firms are increasingly adopting cloud-based document management solutions and virtual platforms to continue their work remotely and to complete collaborative tasks.

However, legal innovation in Singapore can be traced back to as early as the 1990s. In 1995, the first technology court was launched in the Supreme Court, where oral testimony could be digitally recorded and video conferencing could be used to connect with jurisdictions such as the UK, Australia, and Switzerland, for witnesses could give evidence remotely. 

The Courts implememted an Electronic Filing System (EFS) in 1997, to allow court documents to be prepared, filed, processed, stored, retrieved, updated, and served electronically. This was revamped as the E-Litigation (eLIT) system in 2013. Additional specialised case management systems were been introduced from 2014 to 2017. These techology solutions help users to understand and navigate the Court processes and allow lawyers to present cases more effectively. 

There have been various efforts to increase the adoption of legal tech in the industry. 

- Under Tech-celerate for Law, launched by the Law Society of Singapore, in partnership with the Ministry of Law, Enterprise Singapore and Info-Communications Media Development Authority, qualified Singapore Law Practices are able to select and adopt legal technology solutions from 7 pre-scoped categories with up to 80% funding support in the first year of implementatrion. These legal technology solutions range from baseline to advanced categories, with products powered by advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence. 

- The Legal Industry Framework for Training and Education (LIFTED) initiative, launched by Singapore Academy of Law, provides a mapping of competencies for legal professionals and associate professionals, to provide clear professional development pathways and learning journeys to guide continuing legal education, and set up a community of thought in legal education to review the aims and means of legal education in the light of increasingly global nature of legal services.

- The Future Law Innovation Programme (FLIP) is an industry-wide initiative led by the Singapore Academy of Law, to drive innovation and encourage the adoption and invention of new technology amongst law firms, legal departments and legal tech startups, to create a vibrant legal technology ecosystem in Singapore. This include consultancy advice for law firms who want to modernise their practice and need to build capacity for innovation, workshops for law firms and in-house legal teams  to explore new ways of delivering legal services, new revenue streams, new business models, and new solutions, and initiatives to support legal tech ventures commercialise and scale their businesses, in Singapore and beyond.

Moving forward, we can expect technology disruptions to be inevitable in many industries, where data analytics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, online/app service platforms and new technologies of the future will have a transformative impact across many sectors. Against the larger context of a changing texture of society and external environment, the Singapore legal community will continue to work together to ride the tech wave.
