**World class legal system**

Singapore is a republic with a parliamentary system of government based on the Westminster model. It has a world-class legal system rooted in English law and practice. It has many similarities with other common-law legal systems in the world, while being exposed to civil law traditions through international trading and from its Asian neighbours.

**High quality education system**

The legal education in Singapore is among the best in the world, with a variety of prestigious and well-known institutions which recruit world class talents to enhance the legal capabilities

**Pro-business environment**

Its pro-business environment have attracted leading law firms, businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs to establish their regional and global operations here.

**Strong legal community**

Singapore has a broad base of legal service providers to cater to the regional and international needs of businesses.

Almost half of the top 100 law firms in the world based on revenue have offices in Singapore, allowing access to top-tier international legal advice from renowned legal advisors from many European and Asian jurisdictions.

Singapore law practices are among the largest in South East Asia, and have strong regional expertise. Many of our law practices have access to networks of law firms across the region and globe, or offices in other jurisdictions.

**Diverse range of law practice entities**

The legal sector in Singapore contains a diverse range of law practice entities, each with a unique offering to meet every legal need.

There are over 1,000 law firms and close to 5,700 lawyers, including around 130 foreign law firms and 1,200 foreign lawyers.

Singapore Law Practices include sole-proprietorships, partnerships, Limited Liability Law Partnerships, and law corporations.

In addition, international law practices and networks from myriad jurisdictions have established offices in Singapore as licensed Foreign Law Practices that advise on foreign law. Selected law practices, designated as Qualifying Foreign Law Practices, are also able to advise on specific areas of Singapore law.

Collaborations between Singapore Law Practices and Foreign Law Practices in the form of Joint Law Ventures and Formal Law Alliances offer more options for cross-border legal work, combining local expertise with foreign know-how.

International law practices have also set up Representative Offices in Singapore, which cannot offer legal services but provide client services and business development opportunities for their parent law practices.
