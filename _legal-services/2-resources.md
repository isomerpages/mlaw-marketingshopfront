**Legal services**

Legal services such as patent application to safeguard innovative solutions or a non-disclosure agreement for confidentiality may be required for businesses.  To address demand for legal services, there are more than 900 law practices in Singapore, covering a range of practice areas including corporate and commercial law, and intellectual property law. The [Legal Service Regulatory Authority (LSRA)](https://eservices.mlaw.gov.sg/lsra/search-lawyer-or-law-firm/) offers an integrated search function listing all lawyers, individuals and law practice entities registered with the LRSA and/or the Supreme Court of Singapore. 


**Financial services**

The [MAS](https://www.mas.gov.sg/) website provides an overview on the finance landscape here. Most businesses start with opening a corporate bank account.  In Singapore, established local banks operate alongside international brand names. Different banks offer their own unique set of advantages. To choose the right bank for your business, refer to [MASâ€™ financial instituitions directory](https://eservices.mas.gov.sg/fid) for a list of local and international banks operating in Singapore.
