Singapore Law Practices include sole-proprietorships, partnerships, Limited Liability Law Partnerships (LLP), and law corporations (LLC).

Part IXA of the Legal Profession Act provides for the following legal practice entities:

- Singapore law practice (SLP)

- Foreign law practice

- Qualifying foreign law practice.

- Joint law venture (structured as either a partnership or a company)

- Formal law alliance

- Group practice

- Representative offices

SLPs are subject to threshold requirements under Rule 3 of the Legal Profession (Law Practice Entities Rules) 2015. The threshold requirements include limits on the number of foreign lawyers who can practise in, or be directors, partners or shareholders in, or share in the profits of, the SLP.

To qualify to practise as a sole proprietor, partner or director of an SLP, a lawyer must, since being admitted as a solicitor, have been employed for at least three years.
