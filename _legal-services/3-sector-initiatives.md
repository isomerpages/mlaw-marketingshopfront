To help future proof the legal industry, Singapore has various programmes to encourage law practices and lawyers to upskill through continuous legal education and specialised programmes.
 

### [Lawyers Go Global](https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/for-lawyers/going-global/)

Lawyers Go Global programme, developed by the Ministry of Law, Law Society of Singapore and Enterprise Singapore, aims to help Singapore lawyers gain a deeper understanding of the regional demand for legal services and business opportunities, and to connect with the local business and legal communities, through mission trips and training workshops.  

### [China Ready Programme] (https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/news/press-releases/press-releases-new-china-ready-programme-to-help-singapore-lawyers-seize-new-opportunities)

Ministry of Law launched a new China Ready Programme in July 2019 to help Singapore lawyers seize new opportunities presented by Singapore’s deepening cooperation with China, including in legal services. Under this programme, Singapore lawyers have the opportunity to acquire a foundational appreciation of Chinese culture and business environment, understand legal systems and laws, for example foreign investment law, contract law, and specialist areas such as mergers and acquisitions, and dispute resolution, and master legal terms in Mandarin. This programme aims to expand the pool of Singapore lawyers who understand Chinese culture, business environment, legal system and laws, are conversant with Mandarin in the legal context and can work with Chinese companies and law firms to meet businesses’ needs.

### [Continuing Legal Education](https://www.sal.org.sg/lifted)

The Legal Industry Framework for Training and Education (LIFTED) initiative, launched by Singapore Academy of Law, aims to:

- Provide a mapping of competencies for legal professionals and associate professionals, to provide clear professional development pathways and learning journeys to guide continuing legal education
   
- Set up a community of thought in legal education to review the aims and means of legal education in the light of increasingly global nature of legal services.

### [SkillsFuture Study Award for Legal Industry](https://programmes.myskillsfuture.sg/Portal/ProgramDetails.aspx?ProgID=P00000059) 

Singapore lawyers who wish to be foreign qualified can apply for this award which is jointly administered by Ministry of Law and SkillsFuture Singapore, to take the New York State Bar Exam and the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme (for qualification as solicitors in England and Wales).
