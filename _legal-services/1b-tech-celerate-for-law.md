### Tech-celerate for Law

Tech-celerate for Law was a joint effort between the [Law Society of Singapore](https://www.lawsociety.org.sg/), the Ministry of Law, [Enterprise Singapore](https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/) and the [Infocomm Media Development Authority](https://www.imda.gov.sg/) to support Singapore law practices in their digitalisation journey. Through the Tech-celerate scheme, Singapore law practices were empowered to adopt both the baseline and advanced technology solutions required to upgrade their service offerings and deliver enhanced legal services. 

These solutions were pre-scoped by industry and technical experts to ensure relevance and usefulness. With the broad-based deployment of these carefully selected solutions, prospective clients of Singapore law practices can expect services to be delivered with greater efficiency and value than before.
