*[This is a draft write-up.]* 

Singapore has a broad base of legal service providers to cater to the regional and international needs of businesses. The legal sector in Singapore contains a diverse range of law practice entities, each with a unique offering to meet every legal need.

There are over 1,000 law firms and close to 5,700 lawyers, including around 130 foreign law firms and 1,200 foreign lawyers. Of the top 100 law firms in the world by revenue, about 40 have offices in Singapore. 

Singapore law practices are among the largest in South East Asia, and have strong regional expertise. Many of our law practices have access to networks of law firms across the region and globe, or offices in other jurisdictions.

In addition, international law practices and networks from myriad jurisdictions have established offices in Singapore as licensed Foreign Law Practices that advise on foreign law. Selected law practices, designated as Qualifying Foreign Law Practices, are also able to advise on specific areas of Singapore law. International law practices have also set up Representative Offices in Singapore, which cannot offer legal services but provide client services and business development opportunities for their parent law practices.

Collaborations between Singapore Law Practices and Foreign Law Practices in the form of Joint Law Ventures and Formal Law Alliances offer more options for cross-border legal work, combining local expertise with foreign know-how.
