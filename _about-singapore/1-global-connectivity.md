# About Singapore

## Global connectivity

Singapore’s prime geographical location and stellar transportation and communication links make us one of the most well-connected cities in the world. Over 100 airlines fly from Singapore’s award-winning Changi Airport to more than 400 cities around the globe. Travel times are short in our compact city, with excellent infrastructure critical to business travellers. 

COVID-19 has undeniably affected international travel in the face of travel restrictions. Singapore has formulated contigency plans to minimise disruptions and strengthen connectivity.

**Measures to address COVID-19 travel restrictions**

To overcome travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual and hybrid hearing arrangements are available at the Maxwell Chambers and the Singapore International Commercial Court.
