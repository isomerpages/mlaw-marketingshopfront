  - title: The Founding of Singapore and The First Charter of Justice Singapore
    content: <br>The Founding of Singapore and The First Charter of Justice Singapore was founded on 6 February 1819, when a treaty of friendship and alliance was signed by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Sultan Hussein of Johor and Temenggong Abdu'r Rahman. In 1807, the Crown granted the East India Company the First Charter of Justice, which set up a Court of Judicature in Penang.


  - title: The Second Charter of Justice
    content: <br>In 1825, Statute 6 Geo IV c 85 was passed by the British Parliament, enabling the King to make provision for the administration of justice in the British colonies of Singapore and Malacca. These, together with the Prince of Wales' Island (now known as 'Penang') formed the Straits Settlements. <br>The Second Charter of Justice was issued on 27 November 1826. This Charter abolished the Recorder's Court, which served only the Prince of Wales' Island, and established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malaya.<br>In criminal proceedings, the court was "to administer criminal justice in such Manner and Form" as the courts in England, with "due attention being (given) to the several Religions, Manners and Usages of the native Inhabitants". The court was to "give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right" in civil proceedings. <br>The Governor and the Resident Councillor acted as two judges of the court. The third judge was the Recorder, who was based on the Prince of Wales' Island and had to travel on circuit to Malacca and Singapore from his home base. He was assisted in his duties by the Resident Councillors and the Governor, who sat as lay Judges.


  - title: The Third Charter of Justice
    content: <br>The Third Charter of Justice of 12 August 1855 was granted to cope with the increase in the judicial workload which resulted from Singapore's rapid development.<br>Under the Third Charter of Justice, the Court of Judicature was reorganised into two divisions. The first division had jurisdiction over Singapore and Malacca and comprised the Recorder of Singapore, the Governor and the Resident Councillors of Singapore and Malacca. The second division had jurisdiction over the Prince of Wales' Island and Province Wellesley, and comprised the Recorder of Prince of Wales' Island, the Governor and the Resident Councillor of the Prince of Wales' Island.

  - title: New Developments in the judicial system (1868 to 1941)
    content: <br>The Judicial Duties Act of 1867 brought about further changes to our judicial system. The Governor of the Straits Settlements ceased to be a Judge of the Court of Judicature, although the Resident Councillors continued to sit under their new title of Lieutenant-Governors. <br>This Act also changed the titles of other officers- the "Recorder of Singapore" became the "Chief Justice of the Straits Settlements" while the "Recorder of Prince of Wales' Island" became the "Judge of Prince of Wales' Island". Sir Peter Benson Maxwell, then the Recorder of Singapore, became the first Chief Justice of The Straits Settlements in 1867.<br>The Supreme Court Ordinance 1868 abolished the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malacca, replacing it with the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements.<br>In turn, the Courts Ordinance of 1873 reconstituted the Court, so that it now consisted of the Chief Justice, the Judge of Penang, a Senior and a Junior Puisne Judge. One division of the Court sat in Singapore and Malacca, whilst another sat in Penang. In addition, the Ordinance conferred on the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements the jurisdiction to sit as a Court of Appeal, with final appeals lying to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. Previously, appeals had lain only to the King-in-Council. <br>Further changes to the structure of the judicial system were brought by the Courts Ordinance of 1878. This Ordinance was passed in response to the United Kingdom Judicature Acts of 1873-75, which modified the court structure in England. Under the Ordinance, the jurisdiction for the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements was brought in line with that of the new English High Court. <br>The Courts Ordinance of 1907 allowed Judicial Commissioners of the Federated Malay States to be appointed from time to time to perform the duties of a Judge of the Supreme Court of the Straits Settlements. <br>The Court of Criminal Appeal Ordinance came into force on 1 September 1934 to provide for the establishment of a Court of Criminal Appeal. This was necessary as, up till then, the Court of Appeal had exercised only appellate civil jurisdiction.

## Singapore's Legal System

The roots of Singapore’s legal system can be traced back to the English legal system and it has evolved over the years. Our sources of law are derived from our  [Constitution](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963),  [legislation](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/), subsidiary legislation (e.g. Rules and Regulations etc) and judge-made law.

-   The  **Constitution**  is the supreme law of the land and lays down the basic framework for the three organs of state, namely, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
-   The  **Executive**  includes the  [Elected President](https://www.istana.gov.sg/), the  [Cabinet](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/the-cabinet)  and the  [Attorney-General](https://www.agc.gov.sg/). The President is elected by the people and is empowered to veto government budgets and appointments to public office. The Cabinet comprises the  [Prime Minister](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/)and Ministers appointed from among the Members of Parliament and is responsible for the general direction and control of the Government and is accountable to  [Parliament](https://www.parliament.gov.sg/). The Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor to the government and has the power and discretion to prosecute offenders.
-   The  **Legislature**  comprises the President and Parliament and is the legislative authority responsible for enacting legislation. Parliament is made up of elected, non-constituency and nominated Members of Parliament. The President’s assent is required for all bills passed by Parliament and he may in his discretion withhold assent to certain bills.
-   The  **Judiciary**  consists of the  [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/)  and the  [State Courts](https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/)  and the head of the Judiciary is the Chief Justice. Judicial power in Singapore is vested in the Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided for by any written law for the time being in force.
