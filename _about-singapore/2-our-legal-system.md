  - title: The Founding of Singapore and The First Charter of Justice Singapore
    content: <br>The Founding of Singapore and The First Charter of Justice Singapore was founded on 6 February 1819, when a treaty of friendship and alliance was signed by Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, Sultan Hussein of Johor and Temenggong Abdu'r Rahman. In 1807, the Crown granted the East India Company the First Charter of Justice, which set up a Court of Judicature in Penang.

    content: <br>In 1825, Statute 6 Geo IV c 85 was passed by the British Parliament, enabling the King to make provision for the administration of justice in the British colonies of Singapore and Malacca. These, together with the Prince of Wales' Island (now known as 'Penang') formed the Straits Settlements. <br>The Second Charter of Justice was issued on 27 November 1826. This Charter abolished the Recorder's Court, which served only the Prince of Wales' Island, and established the Court of Judicature of Prince of Wales' Island, Singapore and Malaya.<br>In criminal proceedings, the court was "to administer criminal justice in such Manner and Form" as the courts in England, with "due attention being (given) to the several Religions, Manners and Usages of the native Inhabitants". The court was to "give and pass Judgment and Sentence according to Justice and Right" in civil proceedings. <br>The Governor and the Resident Councillor acted as two judges of the court. The third judge was the Recorder, who was based on the Prince of Wales' Island and had to travel on circuit to Malacca and Singapore from his home base. He was assisted in his duties by the Resident Councillors and the Governor, who sat as lay Judges.

## Singapore's Legal System

The roots of Singapore’s legal system can be traced back to the English legal system and it has evolved over the years. Our sources of law are derived from our  [Constitution](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963),  [legislation](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/), subsidiary legislation (e.g. Rules and Regulations etc) and judge-made law.

-   The  **Constitution**  is the supreme law of the land and lays down the basic framework for the three organs of state, namely, the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.
-   The  **Executive**  includes the  [Elected President](https://www.istana.gov.sg/), the  [Cabinet](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/the-cabinet)  and the  [Attorney-General](https://www.agc.gov.sg/). The President is elected by the people and is empowered to veto government budgets and appointments to public office. The Cabinet comprises the  [Prime Minister](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/)and Ministers appointed from among the Members of Parliament and is responsible for the general direction and control of the Government and is accountable to  [Parliament](https://www.parliament.gov.sg/). The Attorney-General is the principal legal advisor to the government and has the power and discretion to prosecute offenders.
-   The  **Legislature**  comprises the President and Parliament and is the legislative authority responsible for enacting legislation. Parliament is made up of elected, non-constituency and nominated Members of Parliament. The President’s assent is required for all bills passed by Parliament and he may in his discretion withhold assent to certain bills.
-   The  **Judiciary**  consists of the  [Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov.sg/)  and the  [State Courts](https://www.statecourts.gov.sg/)  and the head of the Judiciary is the Chief Justice. Judicial power in Singapore is vested in the Supreme Court and in such subordinate courts as may be provided for by any written law for the time being in force.
