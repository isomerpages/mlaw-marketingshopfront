Singapore, a republic with a parliamentary system of government based on the Westminster model, has a world-class legal system rooted in English law and practice. Its strong rule of law, pro-business environment, and high-quality legal expertise and infrastructure have attracted leading law firms, businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs to establish their regional and global operations here.

> Singapore’s sound legal framework is underpinned by strong rule of law, low corruption, and a pro-business environment. The [World Justice Project Rule of Law Index 2020](https://worldjusticeproject.org/our-work/research-and-data/wjp-rule-law-index-2020) ranked Singapore top in Asia and 12th worldwide. [Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index 2019](https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2019) ranked Singapore the 4th least corrupt country in the world – the only Asian country ranked in the top 10. The [World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2020](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/ranking) rankings placed Singapore 2nd in the world for ease of doing business. 

## Attuned to the needs of multinational businesses

[Singapore’s legal system](https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/about-us/our-legal-system) [Note: Will link to MinLaw website] is familiar, yet modern and attuned to the needs of multinational businesses. While rooted in the English law and practice, Singapore’s legal system and laws have constantly evolved to incorporate the best practices of other jurisdictions.

Singapore’s legal system also retains the common law tradition – judicial precedence is an important feature, which offers greater legal certainty for users.

## Responsive

Against the backdrop of COVID-19 pandemic, here are some laws which may address the concerns of businesses:

 - Singapore COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act 2020 provides temporary relief from the inability to perform contractual obligations under certain contracts, if that inability is materially caused by a COVID-19 event. For more information, please click here.

 - Singapore Insolvency, Restructuring and Dissolution Act 2018 includes provisions relating to debtor-in-possession rescue financing, cross-border debt restructuring, cross-class “cram down” mechanisms and a worldwide stay on proceedings, not only for Sinagpore incorporated debtors, but also foreign debtors.
